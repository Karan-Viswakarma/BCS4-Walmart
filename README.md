## About Walmart
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount 
departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million 
customers worldwide.

## Business Problem
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, 
purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make 
better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female 
customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male 
and 50 million are female).
